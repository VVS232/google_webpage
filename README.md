Project for Odin

This is the difficult version of project for The Odin project. Here i decided
to built the page using css grid. I learned how to use Flex during the easy mode, but I
didn't know how to use Grid at all. So I learned by doing. Was it the best idea? I guess, no. 
But it definitelly was worth it. And yet, it works quite well, and even on mobile view
